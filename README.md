# terraform-aws-vpc-peering-multi-account

 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc-peering-multi-account.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc-peering-multi-account) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc-peering-multi-account.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc-peering-multi-account/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to create a peering connection between any two VPCs existing in different AWS accounts.

This module supports performing this action from a 3rd account (e.g. a "root" account) by specifying the roles to assume for each member account.

**IMPORTANT:** AWS allows a multi-account VPC Peering Connection to be deleted from either the requester's or accepter's side. However, Terraform only allows the VPC Peering Connection to be deleted from the requester's side by removing the corresponding `aws_vpc_peering_connection` resource from your configuration. [Read more about this](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpc_peering_accepter.html) on Terraform's documentation portal.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** Do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases. Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc-peering-multi-account/releases).

For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete)

```hcl
module "vpc_peering_cross_account" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc-peering-multi-account.git?ref=master"
  namespace        = "eg"
  stage            = "dev"
  name             = "cluster"

  requester_aws_assume_role_arn             = "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXX:role/cross-account-vpc-peering-test"
  requester_region                          = "us-west-2"
  requester_vpc_id                          = "vpc-xxxxxxxx"
  requester_allow_remote_vpc_dns_resolution = "true"

  accepter_aws_assume_role_arn             = "arn:aws:iam::YYYYYYYY:role/cross-account-vpc-peering-test"
  accepter_region                          = "us-east-1"
  accepter_vpc_id                          = "vpc-yyyyyyyy"
  accepter_allow_remote_vpc_dns_resolution = "true"
}
```

The `arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXX:role/cross-account-vpc-peering-test` requester IAM Role should have the following Trust Policy:

<details><summary>Show Trust Policy</summary>

```js
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXX:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>
<br/>

and the following IAM Policy attached to it:

__NOTE:__ the policy specifies the permissions to create (with `terraform plan/apply`) and delete (with `terraform destroy`) all the required resources in the requester AWS account

<details><summary>Show IAM Policy</summary>

```js
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",

    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeVpcPeeringConnections",
        "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
        "ec2:ModifyVpcPeeringConnectionOptions",
        "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
        "ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute",
        "ec2:DescribeRouteTables"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {

        "ec2:DeleteVpcPeeringConnection",

        "ec2:RejectVpcPeeringConnection"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:XXXXXXXX:vpc-peering-connection/*",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:XXXXXXXX:vpc/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DeleteTags",
        "ec2:CreateTags"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:XXXXXXXX:vpc-peering-connection/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

where `XXXXXXXX` is the requester AWS account ID.

<br/>

The `arn:aws:iam::YYYYYYYY:role/cross-account-vpc-peering-test` accepter IAM Role should have the following Trust Policy:

<details><summary>Show Trust Policy</summary>

```js
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXX:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

__NOTE__: The accepter Trust Policy is the same as the requester Trust Policy since it defines who can assume the IAM Role.
In the requester case, the requester account ID itself is the trusted entity.
For the accepter, the Trust Policy specifies that the requester account ID `XXXXXXXX` can assume the role in the accepter AWS account `YYYYYYYY`.

and the following IAM Policy attached to it:

__NOTE:__ the policy specifies the permissions to create (with `terraform plan/apply`) and delete (with `terraform destroy`) all the required resources in the accepter AWS account

```js

        "ec2:DeleteRoute"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:YYYYYYYY:route-table/*"
    },
    {

        "ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute",
        "ec2:DescribeRouteTables"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:AcceptVpcPeeringConnection",
        "ec2:DeleteVpcPeeringConnection",
        "ec2:CreateVpcPeeringConnection",
        "ec2:RejectVpcPeeringConnection"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:YYYYYYYY:vpc-peering-connection/*",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:YYYYYYYY:vpc/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DeleteTags",
        "ec2:CreateTags"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:YYYYYYYY:vpc-peering-connection/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

where `YYYYYYYY` is the accepter AWS account ID.
